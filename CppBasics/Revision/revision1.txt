9. C-Structure / CPP Structure
10. DO structure can have func? -> YES
11. DO structure can have cons./desc? -> YES
12. DO structure can have access modifier ? -> YES
13. Memory Padding ?
14. M / P in structure / Class?
15. Classs default - ACCESS MODIFIER -> private
    Structure default - ACCESS MODIFIER -> public
16. Difference between Array of Object vs Array of data member?
17. How can access the private data member of class through object?
    -> it is not possible directly but can be done by getter / setter 
    -> or by friend function or by copy constructor by calling the obj of the class as the parameters.
18. Difference between Constructor & Destructor?    
19. Mandatory or Optional to use Constructor & Destructor?
    -> Mandatory for class but Optional for programmer to use.
20. Do Constructor/Destructor have any return type? -> NO
21. Can I have multiple Cons?
    -> constructor overloading
22. How a object is copied ? -> Copy Constructor
23. Is it compulsory to have copy constructor?
    -> Mandatory for class but Optional for programmer to use.
24. Give me ways

27. How many copies of class variable per 10 objects & how?
28. Is it Mandatory to have defination of function inside class? -> NO
29. How? 
30. What is SRO? -> It is the varaible/operator used to resolve the scope of program entities.
31. Use of SRO?
32. What is Static Function?
    -> can only use static member or static varaible.
33. Diff between Static vs Normal Function?
    -> Normal func can use static member but static function cannot use normal member.
36. Can I use static in Constructors? -> YES
37. What is inheritance?

40. Default Mode of Inheritance?
41. Default Access  specifier of class? -> Private
42. What is func over loading? -> EXAMPLE IN CLASS is CONSTRUCTOR overloading
43. Can I have 1 defination of class contructor behave as contructor for difference implementation
    -> parameterized contructor with difference values
44. Can I have same func in base and derived class? -> YES 
45. function overriding?
46. difference between overloading vs overriding?
