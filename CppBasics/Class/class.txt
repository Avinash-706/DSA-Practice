Fundamentally if the class is in public mode it is equivalent to structure.
Example in our code we just changed 'STRUCT' to 'CLASS' and added public. 

If the data member is private it cannot be accessed outside the class by the object directly.

BY DEFAULT EVERYTHING INSIDE A CLASS IS "PRIVATE"

In classes data member  & methods are binded internally, so methods will update in the 
value of those data member, whose object is calling the method.

Method Functions inside the class
DATA MEMBER / MEMBER Functions
Suppose I have to do some initialisations of data members, then there is  a special Functions call CONSTRUCTOR.
CONSTRUCTOR is always PUBLIC.
The JOB of CONSTRUCTOR is initialisations of a data member.

for deletion = destructor()

CONSTRUCTOR is called automatically when the OBJECT IS CREATED.

ORDER OF CONSTRUCTOR and DESTRUCTOR calling 

CONSTRUCTOR is called in the order of object creation.
DESTRUCTOR in order of D
