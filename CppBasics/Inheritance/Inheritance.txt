ACCESS MODIFIER -> 

1.Protected -> It is specifically created for inheritance. It works like private, 
               meaning the member is not accessible outside the class directly,
               but it can be accessed by derived (child) classes.

2. Private -> Members marked as private cannot be inherited by the derived class.
              They are only accessible within the class itself.

3. Public -> Members marked as public can be accessed anywhere, both inside and
             outside the class. In terms of inheritance, these members can be inherited
             by the derived (child) class and accessed from outside the class as well.
