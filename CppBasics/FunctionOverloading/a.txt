//FUNCTION SIGNATURE - uniquely identifies a function. It contains -
1. Name of the function.
2. Argument List (i.e., Number of Argument and Types of Argument)

-------

EXACT MACTH - is called when you have same matching of Signature.

-------

When you have Multiple Functions with Same NAME and during a function 
call EXACT MATCH is not found, the complier tries IMPLICIT ATYPE CASTING
of the values to resolve the Function Call, then CONFLICT Situation can 
arrive.
Example - You are calling a function "Print" with an Argument INTEGER and 
INTEGER Argument is not present in function call. Then, INTEGER can either be 
typecasted to CHAR or DOUBLE, or if both are present then it can lead to 
the Situation of CONFLICT.

-------

NORMAL ORDER OF TYPECASTING - CHAR, INTEGER, DOUBLE

-------

METHOD FOR CONFLICT RESOLUTION---
1. Always give Exact Match.
2. Don't Give same TypeCasted Functions.
